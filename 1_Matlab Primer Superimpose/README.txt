% Convert the grayscale image into a binary mask using a threshold value
Choosing threshold = 0.5 will decided 0 or 1 pixel intensity value based on threshold pixel value halfway between the minimum and maximum value of the class.

I also tried with threshold upto .95, and it gives similar result with just few different pixel values noticed on the edge/boundary. For this example, where the edges are simple high threshold value is giving good images. 

As a design choice, I chose threshold = 0.75
